# Machine learning supersymmetry

The main goal of this project is to build a ML model to predict a binary target (signal in a detector), and contrast this with the DL model used in [1]. In order to achieve this I have implemented a ML workflow using various classifiers (e.g. Logistic regression, SVM, XGBoost).
